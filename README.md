This repository is created to add/remove flex slots on bigquery on commitments, reservations & assignments.

Flex Slot commitments are purchases charged in increments of 500 slot hours for $20, or ~$0.33/minute. You can increase your slot commitments if you need faster queries or more concurrency.
Reservations create a named allocation of slots, and are necessary to assign purchased slots to a project. Find details on reservations in this documentation.
Assignments assign reservations to Organizations, Folders, or Projects. All queries in a project will switch from on-demand billing to purchased slots after the assignment is made.
